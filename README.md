## ðŸ“Š Overview

The **Smart Loan Recovery System** analyzes borrower data and uses ML algorithms to:

- Predict whether a loan is likely to be recovered
- Identify important financial and demographic factors affecting recovery
- Provide insights through interactive visualizations

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Workflow

### âœ… Steps Included:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** â€“ handled missing values, formatted columns
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ visualized trends in income, loan amount, recovery status
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ transformed skewed data, created new features
4. **Model Training** â€“ tested models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
5. **Evaluation** â€“ accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall
6. **Visualization** â€“ histograms, scatter plots, feature importance
